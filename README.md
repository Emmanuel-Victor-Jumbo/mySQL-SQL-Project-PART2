# mySQL-SQL-Project-PART2

This project involved the implementation of efficient, high speed queries using SQL in order to obtain information from a relational database(IMDB). The subset of IMDBâ€™s database queried in this project holds over 270000 data entries across 9 tables. Where the tables cover information on movie titles, ratings, writers, running times, directors and actors. Some insights generated from this project included: discovering the top film genre while using the average rank per film genre as a metric, finding number of movies with more female than male actors and generating a list of actors that have starred in different film genres. Some concepts utilised included: nested queries, aggregate functions, different types of JOINs, etc.
